## Synthese Algorithm ##

https://synthese-algorithmus.thbruhn.de/

A site for learning the synthese algorithm. 
You can input the dependencies and see what the algorithm does step by step.

### What was used? ###

* aurelia, sass

### How do I get set up? ###

* `git clone https://github.com/bruhnth17/SyntheseAlgorithm.git && cd SyntheseAlgorithm`
* `npm install`
* `sass watch src/`
* `au run --watch`

I started this project with little 
knowledge about aurelia and MVC pattern in general.
Also it was my first time writing this much on my own, so the code got a bit messy.
Please don't let that keep you from changing stuff. An idea a friend had,
is to make predefined dependencies possible. So you don't have to fill in the excercise from everyone else 
is doing anyway.
